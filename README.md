# What is Supervised Contrastive learning? :
Supervised Contrastive Loss is an alternative loss function to cross entropy that the authors argue can leverage label information more effectively. Clusters of points belonging to the same class are pulled together in embedding space, while simultaneously pushing apart clusters of samples from different classes.
